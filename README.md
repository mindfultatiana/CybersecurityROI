# Cybersecurity ROI Metrics Application
The program is utility-specific. It allows you to get the estimated savings for preventing data breaches so you can report it to your executive team or board of directors. Showing the financial value of cybersecurity efforts gives IT and other departments credibility.

## Required Core Inputs:

```
BASIC INPUTS (Required):
□ Attack Surface Size: _______ (number of critical assets)
□ Zero Trust Effectiveness: _____% (expected risk reduction)

OPTIONAL CUSTOMIZATION:
□ Custom Breach Cost: $_______ (leave blank to use $6.45M industry standard)
□ Asset Criticality: _____ (1.0-3.0, use 2.0 for utilities)
□ Downtime Hours per Breach: _____ (use 24 if unsure)

CLIENT-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
□ Current monthly cybersecurity spend: $_______
□ Annual revenue: $_______
□ Number of customers served: _______
□ Regulatory environment: _______
```
### Input Explanation
1. *Attack Surface Size (integer)*
- Number of critical endpoints, systems, or high-value assets
- Examples: servers, SCADA systems, IoT devices, workstations
- Typical range: 500-5,000 for utilities

2. *Zero Trust Effectiveness Rate (decimal 0.0-1.0)*
- Estimated risk reduction percentage from zero trust implementation
- Example: 0.75 = 75% risk reduction
- Typical range: 0.60-0.90

### Optional Customization Inputs:

3. *Custom Breach Cost (dollar amount, optional)*
- Client's estimated cost per cybersecurity breach
- If not provided, uses industry benchmark ($6.45M for energy sector)
- Should include: incident response, recovery, legal, regulatory fines

4. *Asset Criticality Score (decimal 1.0-3.0, optional)*
Multiplier for how critical the client's assets are
- 1.0 = standard criticality
- 2.0 = high criticality (default for utilities)
- 3.0 = extremely critical infrastructure

5. *Average Downtime Hours (integer, optional)*
- Expected hours of operational downtime per breach
- Default: 24 hours

Critical for utilities due to service continuity requirements

## Executive Friendly Features

It includes Executive friendly visualizations, and has multiple dimensions of value beyond just breach prevention with the following elements:

#### Industry-Specific Focus: 
Added renewable energy utility benchmarks including
- Operational downtime costs (critical for utilities)
- Regulatory compliance considerations
- Reputation damage factors.

#### Comprehensive Cost Model: 
- Direct breach costs
- Operational downtime costs
- Regulatory compliance savings
- Reputation protection value

#### Statistical Rigor: 
- Added confidence intervals using Monte Carlo simulation to provide more credible estimates for executive presentations.

#### Executive-Ready Visualizations: 
- Savings breakdown pie chart
- Confidence interval visualization
- Cumulative savings projection
- ROI comparison charts

#### Enhanced Methodology:
- Baseline risk calculation based on attack surface size
- Asset criticality scoring
- ROI metrics calculation
- Scenario analysis capabilities

#### Professional Reporting: 
- Generated executive summary tables and comprehensive monthly reports suitable for board presentations.

## Information to Gather

### Infrastructure Assessment:
- How many servers, endpoints, and IoT devices do they have?
- What are their most critical systems (generation, distribution, control systems)?
- How many employees have network access?

### Current Security Posture:
- What security measures are currently in place?
- Have they experienced any incidents in the past?
- What's their current cybersecurity budget?

### Business Impact Understanding:
- What does an hour of downtime cost them in lost revenue?
- What regulatory requirements do they face (NERC CIP, etc.)?
- How would a breach affect customer trust and reputation?

### Zero Trust Implementation Plan:
- What level of zero trust implementation are they considering?
- Timeline for rollout?
- Expected effectiveness based on their specific environment?

## Realistic Example Values:
For a mid-sized renewable energy utility:
- Attack Surface Size: 2,500 endpoints
- Zero Trust Effectiveness: 75% (0.75)
- Custom Breach Cost: $8,000,000
- Asset Criticality: 2.0 (high criticality)
- Downtime Hours: 24 hours

The program will handle all the complex calculations and generate professional charts and metrics using these inputs. You can also run multiple scenarios by adjusting these parameters to show best-case, worst-case, and most likely outcomes for the executive presentation.
