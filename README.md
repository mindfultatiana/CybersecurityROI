# Cybersecurity ROI Metrics Application
The calculator allows you to get the estimated savings for preventing data breaches. This way you can report it to your executive team or board of directors. It also outputs a dashboard report with visual representations. Showing the financial value of cybersecurity gives IT and other departments credibility for their efforts. This helps with budgetary requirements, which can often be a hard sell. Right now the python script is set up with sample industry data for a mid-size renewable energy utility. The output of that data is listed below. Change the values you need to update it properly. 

View the [Realistic Example Values](https://github.com/mindfultatiana/CybersecurityROI/blob/main/README.md#realistic-example-values) section below to get a list of what you may want to update. 

I've also included the [Information to Gather](https://github.com/mindfultatiana/CybersecurityROI/edit/main/README.md#information-to-gather) section with questions that can be used to help fill in the values.

## Realistic Example Values:
For a mid-sized renewable energy utility:
- Attack Surface Size: 2,500 endpoints
- Zero Trust Effectiveness: 75% (0.75)
- Custom Breach Cost: $8,000,000
- Asset Criticality: 2.0 (high criticality)
- Downtime Hours: 24 hours

The program will handle all the complex calculations and generate professional charts and metrics using these inputs. You can also run multiple scenarios by adjusting these parameters to show best-case, worst-case, and most likely outcomes for the executive presentation.

### Input Explanation
1. *Attack Surface Size (integer)*
- Number of critical endpoints, systems, or high-value assets
- Examples: servers, SCADA systems, IoT devices, workstations
- Typical range: 500-5,000 for utilities

2. *Zero Trust Effectiveness Rate (decimal 0.0-1.0)*
- Estimated risk reduction percentage from zero trust implementation
- Example: 0.75 = 75% risk reduction
- Typical range: 0.60-0.90

3. *Custom Breach Cost (dollar amount, optional)*
- Client's estimated cost per cybersecurity breach
- If not provided, uses industry benchmark ($6.45M for energy sector)
- Should include: incident response, recovery, legal, regulatory fines

4. *Asset Criticality Score (decimal 1.0-3.0, optional)*
Multiplier for how critical the client's assets are
- 1.0 = standard criticality
- 2.0 = high criticality (default for utilities)
- 3.0 = extremely critical infrastructure

5. *Average Downtime Hours (integer, optional)*
- Expected hours of operational downtime per breach
- Default: 24 hours
- Critical for utilities due to service continuity requirements
